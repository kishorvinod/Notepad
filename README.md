npm install
npm run dev

I've created a feature-rich notepad application with the following features:

Modern Monaco Editor (same as VS Code) with:

Syntax highlighting
Line numbers
Minimap
Word wrap
Multiple language support
Dark theme

Tab Management:

Multiple file tabs
Create new files
Close tabs
Switch between tabs
Clean UI with:

Toolbar with common actions
Tab bar showing open files
Full-screen editor
Dark theme for reduced eye strain
State Management:

Using Zustand for efficient state management
Persistent tab state
Clean separation of concerns
The application is now running and you can:

Click "New" to create a new file
Edit files in the Monaco editor
Switch between multiple tabs
Close tabs using the X button
